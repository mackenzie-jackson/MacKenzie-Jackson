        <hr> Hi! My name is MacKenzie Jackson and I am currently a sophmore at Gonzaga University. 
            I study Business Administration with a concentration in marketing, with a double minor in public relations and digital marketing.
            I am aiming to work in the motorsport industry in the future, specifically Formula 1, but any career in sports is a dream!
            I chose marketing because it highlights my creativity and passion for creating.
            I am from a small town called San Carlos which is in the San Francisco Bay Area, and growing up, I was surrounded by many creative outlets.
            I utilize my creativity through some of my hobbies, some of which are playing guitar, ceramics, and writing. 
            In the future I aspire to work alongside Formula 1 teams and use my skills in creativity to find a position in marketing where I can excel. 
            The possibility of working in motorsports in the future continues to excites me every day and I work hard to acheive my goal.

        <h3>Personal Project</h3>
        <hr> One thing that I really enjoy doing every so often is making music. I find this as a really fun creative outlet for me. I have played guitar for 5 years, and I have also always been a good writer, so when I combine those things, I can create songs that tell a story or dive deeper into my emotions. This pushes my creative thinking and discover ways to make it all blend together well. This is something that I keep to myself, so it isnâ€™t necessarily a big overarching project like creating a full album, I simply like to write songs here and there about my life. This is one of many creative outlets I enjoy.
