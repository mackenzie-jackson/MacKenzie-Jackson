            <hr>When first starting this class, I was intrigued and curious to see what we were going to learn about. Everything was so new to me, and I wasn’t sure if I was going to understand or enjoy any of it. But we started working with coding software, and I was immediately interested. I loved making websites and customizing them to look how I wanted. Even though it was a struggle, it was very rewarding when it all came together. This was definitely something that interested me throughout the semester as we kept making new websites, gradually getting more difficult with the features we included in them. Having this experience from this course is valuable to me, and I hope I can take this knowledge with me into the future. This course also got me excited for a class I am taking next semester, which is another BMIS class. I am not really sure what we are going to be learning, but I hope I will enjoy it as much as I did with this one. Another thing I found myself very curious about this semester was SQL queries. These definitely posed a challenge to me as they were very intricate at times. Every detail matters, and these queries will not run unless every detail is correct. This was a new way of data retrieval for me, but I thought it was very interesting. I enjoyed this class and found new things that interest me, which makes me excited for the MIS classes I will take in the future. We learned about many different concepts and software to use that will help us excel in the future. Overall, I am grateful this class taught me so many skills that I will take with me throughout my time at Gonzaga and beyond.

            <hr> One topic from MIS this semester that I am most curious about has been coding. Coding using Visual Studio Code has been enjoyable for me. Using Visual Studio Code, I could code websites and web browsers about different topics. Some of these topics included my hobbies/interests, my schooling, and my family. I was able to send my websites to others for them to view and interact with. I was able to make a home page, add pictures, and make lists. I used W3 Schools to find more information and new techniques which helped elevate the website when coding. This included add-ons, different pages, emojis and toggle buttons. W3 Schools served as a valuable resource for discovering new techniques and coding practices. Especially when writing code on the Script pages. This is because each coding portion of the script controls how the page is set up and how it can be used. This was fun to experiment with and learn more about how to format a website by coding. This process not only expanded my technical skill set but also demonstrated the creative potential of coding in shaping functional and aesthetically pleasing websites.
