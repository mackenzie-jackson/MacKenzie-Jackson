        <hr> My name is Catherine Letcher and I am a sophomore at Gonzaga University. I am majoring in Business focusing on Digital Marketing and Public Relations. I am originally from Davis, California which is a city boardering Sacramento. In the future, I want to work in Sports Marketing or Brand Marketing for a company. This would entail advertising and advertisement interactions from customers and outside users from websites that include the advertisements. I would use my skills to create digital advertisements and see how users interact with those advertisements.

        <h3>Personal Project</h3>
        <hr> A personal achievement of mine was becoming a section leader in the choir that I currently sing in at Gonzaga. I joined Musea last Fall and have been a contributing member but this fall semester, I was able to become a section leader and help my choir even more. Section Leaders are a huge part of our choir due to its size, especially this year because we have about 60 girls in the choir. I help in sectionals, check in on my section, and especially when it comes to concerts, I am able to be around and help my choir and section stay ready for rehearsals and performances.
